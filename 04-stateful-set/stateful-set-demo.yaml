# This StatefulSet will create 2 pods: nginx-0 and nginx-1.
# Index generated by StatefulSet, starting from 0.
# These pods will be exported by the headless service defined in headless-service.yaml
# According to the headless service rule, the DNS will be resolved to the following format:
# <Pod name>-<index>.<Service name>.<Namespace>.svc.cluster.local
# According statefulSet rule, Pod name will be <StatefulSet name>-<index>,
# So, finally, the DNS will be resolved to the following format:
# <Pod name>-<index>.<Service name>.<Namespace>.svc.cluster.local
# e.g. nginx-0.nginx.default.svc.cluster.local
